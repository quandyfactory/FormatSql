FormatSql README

FormatSql takes unformatted SQL and returns (wait for it) formatted SQL. Right now it's pretty rudimentary and not very cutomizable - but I plan to change that over time.

## Things I Wish FormatSql Had

### Customization

Right now it formats your SQL the way it formats it - and you'll *learn* to *like it*! It would be nice if you could customize the format.

### Support for comments

Yeah, right now the format_sql function doesn't know what to do with comments - either inline or block. I should probably do something about that.

### Syntax Highlighting

More of a 'nice to have' than a requirement, but a boy can dream.

### Support for different SQL dialects

Right now it's optimized for SQL Server, simply because that's the version of SQL I use in which anyone cares about the format.
